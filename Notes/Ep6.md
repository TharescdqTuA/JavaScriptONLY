# Episode 6: undefined Vs. not defined in JS

When JS is in memory allocation phase, it allocates each variable to a placehold. That placeholder is known as *undefined*.

*undefined* is like allocating memory but not provided value yet.

If a JS variable/object is not even found in memory allocation phase, it is never assigned as *undefined* also. So if tried to accessed, it shows *error: NOT DEFINED* as it is never allocated.

*undefined* is not empty; it takes up memory. It stays undefined until it gets a value assigned to it.

JavaScript is a *loosely-typed*/*weakly-typed* language.

One can assign a number to it initially and can change whenever required to string, boolean etc.

__NEVER__ assign *undefined* to any variable. Let it be used for its purpose only!
